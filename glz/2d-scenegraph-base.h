// 3. If you make something comersiol or at least something you release publicly that relies on this code then i would like to know and maybe use in my CV
// 4. Please do include me in your credits

// glz 2d scenegraph base class - i think it's usefull
// visit http://www.flashbang.se or contact me at overlord@flashbang.se
// the entire toolkit should exist in it's entirety at github
